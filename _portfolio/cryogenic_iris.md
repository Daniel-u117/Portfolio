During my senior year at UCSB, I ventured beyond my Physics major to voluntarily participate in the Mechanical Engineering Capstone Project. This year-long project culminated in a significant contribution to the [UCSB Engineering Design Expo 2023](https://capstone.engineering.ucsb.edu/events/expo-2023). My team and I showcased our innovative solution to enhance the testing process of Focal Plane Arrays (FPAs) in collaboration with our sponsor, Senseeker, a company whose operations are pivotal in mission-critical fields such as military and space endeavors.

## Design
FPAs are crucial in mission-critical applications such as military and space operations. Traditional testing methods for these components involve the use of a fixed-sized aperture within a cryogenic vacuum chamber. This method has been cumbersome and time-intensive, demanding repetitive aperture changes and vacuum reestablishment, consuming up to six hours for a single sensor test at varying aperture sizes. To streamline this, we conceived a variable-aperture mechanism within the vacuum chamber. Our invention integrates a cryogenically-cooled, mechanically-controlled iris, greatly shortens the FPA testing duration and boosts operational efficiency.

Our design features a iris diaphragm actuated by a vacuum feedthrough and maintained under cryogenic temperature during testing. The design process involved rigorous research and development, engaging deeply in part design, material selection, and manufacturing technique exploration. We collaborated with global vendors and campus workshop experts to confirm optimal material choices and constructed prototypes to refine our design. We also conducted thermodynamic simulations using COMSOL to ensure minimum heat leakage, validating our design's efficacy. We designed the mechanical components using Solidworks and produced through CNC and EDM machining techniques.

After finishing assembly, the prototype were tested using the Lake Shore Cryotronics system along with cryogenic temperature sensors to confirm the achievement of target cryogenic conditions. To complete the test, I received comprehensive training in liquid nitrogen handling and vacuum pump operations. 

## Result
Our efforts led to the design capable of adjusting the aperture from 0 to 1.5 inches, with precise control up to 0.0005-inch resolution, while maintaining all components under 87.5K and achieving a high vacuum level of 4.1e-7 torr without visible Foreign Object Debris (FOD). Most importantly, our design potentialized reducing the standard test process duration from six days to merely one day.

Participating in the Mechanical Engineering Capstone Project as a Physics student was both challenging and rewarding. It allowed me to collaborate closely with a team of mechanical engineering students, granted me a comprehensive view of the product development cycle, from conception through manufacturing.
