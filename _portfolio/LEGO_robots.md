In my senior year, I joined the ME 179L Robotics: Design Laboratory course as a Physics student. In this course, I designed and built a number of autonomous robots using Arduino Uno, LEGO components, various sensors, and DC and servo motors. Projects included:
- An obstacle-detecting robot employing bump switches for autonomous navigation around barriers.
- A precision robot utilizing dead reckoning to travel a specific distance and stop accurately.
- A wall-following robot, implementing PID control to maintain a set distance from walls and effectively turn corners.
- A line-following robot skilled in detecting and trailing along black lines.

- An interactive "Robo-rat" designed to autonomously navigate a field and collect cubic "cheese," demonstrating object detection and collection mechanics.
