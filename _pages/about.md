Hello! My name is Daniel. I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics from the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I had a concentration in Mechanical Engineering and Robotics. My physics background gives me a solid theoretical basis and honed my logical analysis skill, while my experience in robotics research, mechanical design, and material testing made me capable of handling practical problems effectively. In my recent employment at Apple, I focused on inspecting nanomechanical properties of materials through nanoindentation testing. I also have proficiency in programming languages including Python and C++, and am skilled in CAD modeling. Currently, I am on the lookout for full-time opportunities in robotics and hardware testing, and I am more than excited to explore other fields that align with my skills and interests.
